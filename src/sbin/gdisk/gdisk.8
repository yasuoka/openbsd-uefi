.Sh NAME
.Nm gdisk
.Nd GPT partition maintenance program
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm gdisk
.Op Fl eiy
.Ar disk
.Sh DESCRIPTION
On the amd64 and other architectures, the MBR partition table is being
replaced by the GUID partition table.
For backwards compatibility, the area for the MBR is not being touched.
The GUID partition table starts at sector 1, directly after the MBR.
The MBR partition table should be marked as
.Dq protected
by replacing all partitions with one of type 0xEE.
.Pp
Upon first access to a disk, the partition information is retrieved,
typically in
.Xr disklabel 5
format.
The location of the disklabel can vary from architecture to architecture,
but if one is not found the existence of an GPT partition table will create
a spoofed prototypical disklabel which can be viewed using
.Xr disklabel 8 .
This spoofing mechanism is useful for permitting partition access for
devices which would not normally have a
.Xr disklabel 5
sector.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl e
Use the
.Nm
interactive editor to modify an GPT partition table.
See
.Sx COMMAND MODE ,
below, for more information.
.It Fl i
Requests that the GPT partition data be re-initialized.
In this mode,
.Nm
will completely overwrite the GPT partition table.
As default, GPT partition number 0 will be configured as an
.Ox
GPT partition spanning the entire disk, except for a zone left at the start
for booting.
This mode is designed to initialize the GPT the very first time.
.It Fl y
Avoid asking yes/no questions when not desirable.
.It Ar disk
Specify the
.Ar disk
to operate on.
It can be specified either by its full pathname or an abbreviated disk form.
In its abbreviated form, the path to the device, the
.Sq r
denoting
.Qq raw device ,
and the partition letter, can all be omitted.
For example, the first IDE disk can be specified as either
.Pa /dev/rwd0c ,
.Pa /dev/wd0c ,
or
.Ar wd0 .
.El
.Sh TYPICAL LAYOUT
When called with no special flags,
.Nm
prints the GPT partition table of the specified disk:
.Bd -literal -offset 1n
# gdisk sd0
Disk: sd0       geometry: [1953525168 Sectors]
Offset: 0       Disk UUID: 01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.Ed
.Pp
This 1953525168 sector (931GB) disk drive is divided into two GPT
partitions that span the whole disk.
The first GPT partition is a 200GB FAT-32 partition,
the second is a 731GB
.Ox
GPT partition using the remainder of the disk.
The fields of the output are:
.Bl -tag -width "start/size"
.It Em "#"
Number identifying each GPT partition table entry.
There are a total of four slots.
.Sq *
denotes the GPT partition which is declared bootable.
.It Em "type"
GPT partition type name.
.It Em "name"
GPT partition name.
.It Em "start/size"
These fields provide the starting sector and size in sectors of the
GPT partition in linear block addresses.
.El
.Pp
The
.Ox
GPT partition shown above is subdivided further using the
functionality provided by
.Xr disklabel 8 ,
which provides
.Ox
partitions.

.Sh COMMAND MODE
The
.Fl e
flag causes
.Nm
to enter an interactive command mode.
The prompt contains information about the state of the edit
process.
.Pp
.Dl gdisk:*\*(Gt

.Sq *
means that the in-memory copy of the boot block has been modified, but
not yet written to disk.

The list of commands and their explanations are given below.
Commands may be abbreviated provided enough characters are given to ensure
unambiguity.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm ?\&
A synonym for
.Cm help .
.It Cm help
Display a list of commands that
.Nm
understands in the interactive edit mode.
.It Cm manual
Display this manual page.
.It Cm reinit
Initialize the currently selected, in-memory copy of the
boot block.
.It Cm edit Ar #
Edit a given table entry in the memory copy of
the current boot block.
Sizes may be adjusted mode using sector offsets and sizes.
A unit
.Sq b ,
.Sq k ,
.Sq m ,
or
.Sq g
may be appended to indicate bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, or gigabytes.
The special size value
.Sq *
will cause the partition to be sized to use the remainder of the disk.
.It Cm flags Ar # Op Ar active Ar priority Ar tries Ar success
.Ar active
marks the given GPT partition table entry
bootable by legacy BIOSes and marks all others as not bootable
(only one entry can be marked bootable).
.Ar priority
sets the boot priority for a given entry.
.Ar tries
sets the amount of times this partition is ought to be tried to be booted.
The
.Ar success
field overrides the tries field and marks a partition as always working.
.It Cm setpid Ar #
Change the GPT partition
identifier of the given GPT partition table entry.
This command is particularly useful for reassigning
an existing GPT partition to
.Ox .
.It Cm swap Ar # Ar #
Swap two GPT entries.
.It Cm print Op Ar unit
Print the currently selected in-memory copy of the boot
block and its GPT table to the terminal.
A
.Ar unit
.Sq b ,
.Sq k ,
.Sq m ,
or
.Sq g
may be appended to indicate bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, or gigabytes.
Otherwise the number of sectors is printed.
.It Cm write
Write the in-memory copy of the boot block to disk.
.It Cm exit
Exit the program.
.It Cm quit
Exit the program.
Unlike
.Em exit
it does write the modified block out.
.It Cm abort
Quit program without saving current changes.
