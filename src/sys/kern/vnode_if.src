# Above each of the vop descriptors is a specification of the locking
# protocol used by each vop call.  The first column is the name of
# the variable, the remaining three columns are in, out and error
# respectively.  The "in" column defines the lock state on input,
# the "out" column defines the state on successful return, and the
# "error" column defines the locking state on error exit.
#
# The locking value can take the following values:
# L: locked.
# U: unlocked/
# -: not applicable.  vnode does not yet (or no longer) exists.
# =: the same on input and output, may be either L or U.
# X: locked if not nil.

# succeed). However, these types of failures should be rare. Unfortunately,
