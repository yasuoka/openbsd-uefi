 * Magic wand for lock operations. Every operation checks if certain
 * flags are set and if they aren't, it increments the lock with some
 * value (that might need some computing in a few cases). If the operation
 * fails, we need to set certain flags while waiting for the lock.
 *
 * RW_WRITE	The lock must be completly empty. We increment it with
 *		RWLOCK_WRLOCK and the proc pointer of the holder.
 *		Sets RWLOCK_WAIT|RWLOCK_WRWANT while waiting.
 * RW_READ	RWLOCK_WRLOCK|RWLOCK_WRWANT may not be set. We increment
 *		with RWLOCK_READ_INCR. RWLOCK_WAIT while waiting.
 * RW_UPGRADE	There must be exactly one holder of the read lock.
 *		We increment with what's needed for RW_WRITE - RW_READ.
 *		RWLOCK_WAIT|RWLOCK_WRWANT while waiting.
 * RW_DOWNGRADE	Always doable. Increment with -RW_WRITE + RW_READ.
