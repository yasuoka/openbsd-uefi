	 * LAK:  There seems to be some confusion here about the next line,
	 * so I'll explain.  The kernel needs some way of dynamically modifying
	 * the page tables for its own virtual memory.  What it does is that it
	 * has a page table map.  This page table map is mapped right after the
	 * kernel itself (in our implementation; in HP's it was after the I/O
	 * space). Therefore, the first three (or so) entries in the segment
	 * table point to the first three pages of the page tables (which
	 * point to the kernel) and the next entry in the segment table points
	 * to the page table map (this is done later).  Therefore, the value
	 * of the pointer "Sysmap" will be something like 16M*3 = 48M.  When
	 * the kernel addresses this pointer (e.g., Sysmap[0]), it will get
	 * the first longword of the first page map (== pt[0]).  Since the
	 * page map mirrors the segment table, addressing any index of Sysmap
	 * will give you a PTE of the page maps which map the kernel.
