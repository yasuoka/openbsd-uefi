/*
 * Sun-4c counter/timer registers.  The timers are implemented within
 * the cache chip (!).  The counter and limit fields below could be
 * defined as:
 *
 *	struct {
 *		u_int	t_limit:1,	// limit reached
 *			t_usec:21,	// counter value in microseconds
 *			t_mbz:10;	// always zero
 *	};
 *
 * but this is more trouble than it is worth.
 *
 * These timers work in a rather peculiar fashion.  Most clock counters
 * run to 0 (as, e.g., on the VAX, where the ICR counts up to 0 from a
 * large unsigned number).  On the Sun-4c, it counts up to a limit.  But
 * for some reason, when it reaches the limit, it resets to 1, not 0.
 * Thus, if the limit is set to 4, the counter counts like this:
 *
 *	1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, ...
 *
 * and if we want to divide by N we must set the limit register to N+1.
