 * va_arg picks up the next argument of type `ty'.  Appending an
 * asterisk to ty must produce a pointer to ty (i.e., ty may not be,
 * e.g., `int (*)()').  In addition, ty must not be any type which
 * undergoes promotion to some other type (e.g., char): it must
 * be the promoted type instead.
 *
 * Gcc-2.x tries to use ldd/std for double and quad_t values, but Sun's
 * brain-damaged calling convention does not quad-align these.  Thus,
 * for 8-byte arguments, we have to pick up the actual value four bytes
 * at a time, and use type punning (i.e., a union) to produce the result.
 * (We could also do this with a libc function, actually, by returning
 * 8 byte integers in %o0+%o1 and the same 8 bytes as a double in %f0+%f1.)
 *
 * Note: we cannot use the union trick (which generates better code) for
 * C++, since `ty' might be a type with a constructor (these may not appear
 * in a union).
 *
 * The extraneous casts through `void *' avoid gcc alignment warnings.
