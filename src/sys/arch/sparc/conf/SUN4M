# The system clock (and stat clock) may be set higher than 100 Hz
# On sun4c and sun4m systems.  This is useful if you have a speedy
# machine and need high accuracy timing for real-time oriented applications.
# Note: running the system clock at a higher rate will cause the kernel
#       to use proportionally CPU time handling clock interrupts, 
#       and if set to ridiculously high values may cause problems.
#
# Note: sun4 system will only run the clocks at 100 Hz, other values
#       are ignored.  
#
# On sparc, 1000000 modulo HZ must == 0.  If not, a warning is printed 
#       at boot time, and HZ is reset to 100.

# Note the flags on the esp entries below, that work around

#	bits 8-15: disable synch negotiation for target [bit-8]
#	Note: targets 4-7 have disconnect/reselect enabled on the premise
#	      that tape devices normally have one of these targets. Tape
#	      devices should be allowed to disconnect for the SCSI bus
