# The flags on the esp entries below work around deficiencies in the driver:
#	bits 0-7:  disable disconnect/reselect for the corresponding target
#	bits 8-15: disable synch negotiation for target [bit-8]
#	Note: targets 4-7 have disconnect/reselect enabled on the premise
#	      that tape devices normally have one of these targets. Tape
#	      devices should be allowed to disconnect for the SCSI bus
#	      to operate acceptably.

# NCR5380-based "Sun SCSI 3" VME SCSI controller.
# This driver has several flags which may be enabled by OR'ing

#	0x01		Use DMA (may be polled)
#	0x02		Use DMA completion interrupts
#	0x04		Allow disconnect/reselect
