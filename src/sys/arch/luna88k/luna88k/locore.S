	 *	misaligned access raises an exception
	 *	interrupts disabled
	 *	shadow registers frozen
	 *
	 * The manual says not to disable interrupts and freeze shadowing
	 * at the same time because interrupts are not actually disabled
	 * until after the next instruction. Well, if an interrupt
	 * occurs now, we're in deep trouble anyway, so I'm going to do
	 * the two together.
	 *
	 * Upon a reset (or poweron, I guess), the PSR indicates:
	 *   supervisor mode
	 *   interrupts, shadowing, FPU, misaligned exception: all disabled
	 *
	 * We'll just construct our own turning on what we want.
