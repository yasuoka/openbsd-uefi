To do list (not in any particular order).

    o	Improve pmap_zero_page and pmap_copy_page. Speed and flushing.

    o	Move the RO and WIRED attribute from the pte to the pv table.
	This saves four instructions in the tlb miss handler.
InWork: Have a test version. The system hangs after a while. Not solved yet.
        Also, is it worth the effort to remove 4 instr. in TLB-miss handler?

    o	Update MAKEDEV to create all devices correctly.

    o	Add dos disklabel functionality so disks can be shared with NT.
InWork: mformat needs to be hacked to handle disk labels. Need to figure
        out what method to use (offseting?).

    o   Boot. Standalone boot program instead of booting the kernel directly?

    o   Create boot package for distribution.

    o   sigsetjmp/siglongjmp missing....

    o   Add more videomodes to pccons driver. 50kHz and 64kHz monitors?
InWork: This seems to be hard. Need more info on the chip.

    o   SONIC driver. Use the one from Theo as a start?

    o   Find out why bitmap load to S3-928 flashes screen.
Know why (enable linear mode). Need S3 info.

    o   Would be nice to have Motif...

    o   ELF shared libraries......

    o   Recompile ghostscript to have X driver as well as Cannon BJ200.

    o   GDB. The current one does not work correctly with current toolchain.

    o   ISA driver. ISA dma, interrupt etc.

    o   SONY cd-rom driver + sound driver. Uses ISA dma.

    o   Can we have 32 double registers?


Lots of other things.....
