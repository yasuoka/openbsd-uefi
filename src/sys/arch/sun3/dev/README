$NetBSD: README,v 1.2 1994/10/26 09:08:31 cgd Exp $

NetBSD/sun3 supports the following busses:

Bus:
obio	-  Devices on the motherboard, accessed by having their "registers"
	   mapped into the kernel's virtual address space
obctl	-  Devices on the motherboard accessible only via the 'CONTROL' space,
	   and supporting instructions on the m68k.
obmem	-  Devices on the motherboard that are mapped into main memory
	   by the hardware.  Only true of some framebuffers.
mainbus -  An imaginary bus on which obio, obctl, obmem, and the prom device
	   all reside.

Devices supported:

'obio' Bus: 
Device	Type    Description
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
zs	CHAR	zilog 8530 serial ports; used for serial ports, keybd, mouse
le	IFNET	lance ethernet driver

'obctl' Bus: 
Device	Type    Description
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
idprom	CHAR	makes idprom contents accessible in user-space


The 'prom' device is just wierd as it isn't a real device, but enough
wrapping so that the prom input/output routines can be used to make
the prom's idea of the console both a tty, and a console in the netbsd
sense.

prom	CHAR	prom-based tty and console support
