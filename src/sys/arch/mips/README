This directory is intended to include all Mips common code used by several
ports. This is mainly include files, common locore code, trap code, mmu
code etc.

Any code added here must be endian safe. Code with different ISA targets
has to be well documented and preferbly generate error messages if compiled
without the appropriate switches set.

Questions can be directed to pefo@openbsd.org.
