Currently the bootloader can only be built under RiscOS as this
is the platform which it runs on. A spark file version of the
bootloader source code is also available

[ From boot/README ]
Ok, this is the bootloader source that can be used to boot NetBSD/arm32
from RISCOS. This code was written for use with Norcroft C and
objasm under RISCOS. It has been modified to compile under NetBSD/arm32
but is as yet untested.

It is provided here for the moment as example code for a boot loader
and will be updated shortly to compile under NetBSD/arm32
