 * The size of the FP context is variable depending of the FP emulator

 * The undefined stack needs to be at least 512 bytes. This is a requirement

 * The kernel stack should be at least 4K is size.

 * The stack top addresses are used to set the stack pointers. The stack bottom
 * addresses at the addresses monitored by the diagnostic code for stack overflows
