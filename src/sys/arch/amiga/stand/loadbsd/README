$OpenBSD: README,v 1.3 1998/08/13 21:08:13 espie Exp $

This was prepared to compile with Geek Gadgets' gcc for AmigaOS, with
or without libnix.  The libnix flavor is stand-alone, but still needs
AmigaOS 2.0.

You'll need the (unchanged) getopt.c from src/lib/libc/stdlib, 
and reboot.h from src/sys/sys too.

New for 2.15.2:
compiled with most recent Geek gadgets, everything working.
Looking more closely, the -Z option looks suspiciously untested.
No new options, but smaller, cleaner, and hopefully easier to compile
cleanly.    

New for 2.15.3:
loadbsd knows about poolmem, and will correctly remove it before
firing up the kernel.
