/* hp800-specific comments:
 *
 * Tape driver ALWAYS uses "Alternate Boot Device", which is assumed to ALWAYS
 * be the boot device in pagezero (meaning we booted from it).
 *
 * NOTE about skipping file, below:  It's assumed that a read gets 2k (a page).
 * This is done because, even though the cartridge tape has record sizes of 1k,
 * and an EOF takes one record, reads through the IODC must be in 2k chunks,
 * and must start on a 2k-byte boundary.  This means that ANY TAPE FILE TO BE
 * SKIPPED OVER IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE AN ODD NUMBER OF 1 KBYTE RECORDS so the
 * read of the subsequent file can start on a 2k boundary.  If a real error
 * occurs, the record count is reset below, so this isn't a problem.
