Oh, where do I begin...

1. Integrate 98628A (single port buffered RS232) driver.
2. Integrate 1/2" 9-track reel tape driver (from Mt Xinu).
3. SCSI: sync support and connect/disconnect.
4. VME/EISA adaptor drivers needed.
5. Centronics driver for 345/375.
6. HP-IB (SCSI?) improvement: attempt to get more activity on a single
   bus (e.g. overlap seeks with transfers).
7. Support for more modern (post-DaVinci) displays.
