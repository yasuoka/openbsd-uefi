.Dt INSTALLBOOT 8
.Os 
.Sh NAME
.Nm installboot
.Nd install a bootstrap on a UFS disk or partition
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm installboot
.Op Fl n
.Op Fl v
.Oo Fl s Ar spt Oc
.Oo Fl h Ar tpc Oc
.Ar boot
.Ar biosboot
.Ar rawdev
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm installboot
is used to install a "first-stage" boot program into the boot area
of a UFS or a FFS disk partition, and initialize the table of block
numbers the
.Ar biosboot
program uses to load the second-stage boot program.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width flag_opt
.It Fl n
Do not actually write anything on the disk.
.It Fl v
Be verbose, printing out the CHS (Cylinder, Head, Sector)
triples that are stored in
.Ar biosboot
along with lots of other information.
.It Fl s Ar spt
Used to specify the sectors-per-track value if the drive has
sector translation activated, and
.Nm
is unable to determine the translated geometry.
If not specified, this defaults to d_nsectors from the disklabel.
.It Fl h Ar tpc
Used to specify the tracks-per-cylinder value if the drive has
sector translation activated, and
.Nm
is unable to determine the translated geometry.
If not specified, this defaults to d_ntracks from the disklabel.
.El
.Pp
The arguments are:
.Bl -tag -width biosboot
.It Ar boot
The name of the second-stage boot program in the mounted file system
where the first-stage boot program is to be installed.
.It Ar biosboot
The name of the prototype file for the first stage boot program,
usually /usr/mdec/biosboot.
.It Ar rawdev
The name of the raw device in which the first-stage boot program
is to be installed.  This should correspond to the raw partition
of the block device on which the file system containing
.Ar boot
is mounted.  Note that you must be in single-user mode or have your
kernel in insecure mode (see 
.Xr sysctl 8 's
kern.securelevel variable or /etc/rc.securelevel) to be able
to access the raw partition of a mounted disk.
.El
.Sh BUGS
The disklabel d_type field must be set to a value other than "unknown".
.Pp
You cannot run
.Nm installboot
for drives/partitions others then the one you want /bsd loaded from.
