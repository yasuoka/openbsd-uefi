.Dt BOOT 8 i386
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm boot
.Nd
secondary system bootstrap program
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The main purpose of this program is to load system kernel dealing with
all the bugs and bottlenecks of the PC hardware and it's way of design.
.Pp
As described in the
.Xr boot_i386 8
this program is loaded by the
.Xr biosboot 8
primary bootstrap loader and will give you convinient way to load kernel.
.Pp
Basic operations include:
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
Detecting and switching between multiple consoles.
.It
Loading kernel from any device supported by your system BIOS.
.It
Loading kernels compressed by
.Xr gzip 1
program or
.Xr zlib
routines.
.It
Passing system parameters queried from BIOS to the kernel.
.It
Providing interactive command line.
.El
.Pp
The sequence of it's operation consists of initialization
followed by interactive command line. While in the command
line you have a timeout of 5 seconds (initially, then increasing
by one second on every consequent kernel loading failure)
to type any commands if needed. Upon timeout expiration
kernel will be loaded according to the current variables
settings (See
.Nm set
command for details).
The sequence of
.Nm
operations is like follows:
.Bl -enum
.It
Setup protected mode involving IDT setup for processor exceptions to
be caught and reported and simple real-mode BIOS interface provided.
.It
Probe for console devices, which involves PC internal VGA+keyboard
console and serial console over any of four serial ports. Correspondent
messages reports about found devices to the default console device,
which is pc0, if present.
.It
Probe for memory. Conventional memory probed by quering the BIOS.
Extended memory probed by running through the memory probing
for present pages, which elliminates BIOS restriction for 64M of memory.
found memory is reported as well to the default console device.
.It
Probe for APM support in BIOS. Message printed if support is present.
.It
Open, and if successfull, process
.Pa /etc/boot.conf
file on the same filesystem
.Nm
was loaded from. This file may contain any commands
.Nm
accepts at the interactive prompt.
Ussually they are commands that changes boot parameters according to your
environment, although default values are usable in most cases.
.It
Header line
.Pp
.Dl OpenBSD BOOT [x.xx]
.Pp
is displayed to the active console, where
.Ar x.xx
is a version number of the
.Nm
program, followed by the
.Pp
.Dl boot>
.Pp
prompt, which means you are in the interactive mode and may enter
commands. If you won't,
.Nm
will proceed loading kernel w/ default parameters.
.El
.Sh COMMANDS
The following commands are accepted at the
.Nm
prompt:
.Bl -tag -width machine_diskinfo_boot_
.It boot Op Ar image Op Fl abcds
Boots kernel image specified by the
.Ar image
with options if any. Image specification consists of a pair
.Nm device : Nm filename ,
either of each maybe omitted (':' is not needed if both)
in wich case values from
.Nm
variables will be used.
.It echo
Prints it's arguments.
.It help
Prints a list of available commands and machine dependant
commands, if any.
.It machine Op Ar subcommand
Issues machine-dependant commands. These are defined for i386 architecture:
.Bl -tag -width diskinfo_
.It diskinfo
Prints list of hard disks installed on your system including:
BIOS device number, BIOS translated geometry.
.El
.It ls Op Ar directory
Prints contents of the specified
.Ar directory
in long format including: file type and attributes, owner, group,
size, and ilename.
.It regs
Prints contents of processor registers, if defined for this architecture.
.It reboot
Reboots machine by initiating a warm boot procedure.
.It set Op varname Op value
If invoked without arguments will print list of variables with values.
If
.Ar varname
and
.Ar value
present will set variable with that name to the given value.
Variables include:
.Bl -tag -compact -width boothow
.It addr
Address at wich to load the kernel.
.It howto
Options to pass to the loaded kernel.
.It debug
Debug flag if compiled w/ DEBUG defined.
.It device
Boot device name (ie fd0a, sd0a).
.It tty
Active console device name.
.It image
File name containing the kernel image.
.El
.It time
Displays system time and date.
.El
.Sh FILES
