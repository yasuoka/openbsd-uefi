 * This is a modified version of the keyboard reset code used in syscons.
 * If the keyboard reset fails, we assume that the keyboard has been
 * unplugged and we use a serial port (COM1) as the console instead.
 * Returns 1 on failure (no keyboard), 0 on success (keyboard attached).
 *
 * This grody hack brought to you by Bill Paul (wpaul@ctr.columbia.edu)
