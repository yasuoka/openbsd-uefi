Ok, just a couple quick pointers to people hacking on this stuff.  These
are things that I have found out, and hopefully will make things easier
for the next dude.

First of all, don't trust gas to get the opcodes right.  Look at the
listing (-Wa,a), and check them.  In particular, check for EIP relative
and absolute addressing.  Some of this stuff is pretty hairy in that way.

Debugging this stuff is hell.  Remember that stores directly to video
memory will go a long way towards tracking how far things are getting,
especially when you don't have the BIOS handy.  (movl %0x07410741, 0xb8000)


The basics of the /boot system is the following:

biosboot: 512 bytes of the first sector on the disk/partition.  This loads
/boot (or whatever you did with installboot) into ram.

boot: relocates itself, and starts protected mode.  There is some magic here
in terms of the placement and size of the various segments, as this piece of
code has to switch between real and protected mode many times to load the
next piece of the puzzle, /bsd.gz.

bsd: The kernel itself, can be gzipped if ya want.


The basic steps at creating a boot floppy for yourself, and checking things
out are the following:

1.) Compile a kernel you wish to use.
2.) Compile the new stand stuff.
3.) Mount floppy.
4.) Copy boot and kernel to floppy.  (Kernel could be gzipped if needed)
5.) Run installboot on floppy.
6.) Unmount floppy.
7.) Test...

A quick pasto for ya:
