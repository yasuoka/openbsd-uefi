	# Now check for counter overflow.  This is tricky because the
	# timer chip doesn't let us atomically read the current counter
	# value and the output state (i.e., overflow state).  We have
	# to read the ICU interrupt request register (IRR) to see if the
	# overflow has occurred.  Because we lack atomicity, we use
	# the (very accurate) heuristic that we do not check for
	# overflow if the value read is close to 0.
	# E.g., if we just checked the IRR, we might read a non-overflowing
	# value close to 0, experience overflow, then read this overflow
	# from the IRR, and mistakenly add a correction to the "close
	# to zero" value.
	#
	# We compare the counter value to the heuristic constant 12.
	# If the counter value is less than this, we assume the counter
	# didn't overflow between disabling clock interrupts and latching
	# the counter value above.  For example, we assume that the first 3
	# instructions take less than 12 microseconds to execute.
	#
	# (We used to check for overflow only if the value read was close to
	# the timer limit, but this doesn't work very well if we're at the
	# clock's ipl or higher.)
	#
	# Otherwise, the counter might have overflowed.  We check for this
	# condition by reading the interrupt request register out of the ICU.
	# If it overflowed, we add in one clock period.
