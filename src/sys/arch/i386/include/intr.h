 * Intel APICs (advanced programmable interrupt controllers) have
 * bytesized priority registers where the upper nibble is the actual
 * interrupt priority level (a.k.a. IPL).  Interrupt vectors are
 * closely tied to these levels as interrupts whose vectors' upper
 * nibble is lower than or equal to the current level are blocked.
 * Not all 256 possible vectors are available for interrupts in
 * APIC systems, only
 *
 * For systems where instead the older ICU (interrupt controlling
 * unit, a.k.a. PIC or 82C59) is used, the IPL is not directly useful,
 * since the interrupt blocking is handled via interrupt masks instead
 * of levels.  However the IPL is easily used as an offset into arrays
 * of masks.
