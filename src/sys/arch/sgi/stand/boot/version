No version strings up to 2012
	many changes, but nothing to tell bootblocks about, except perhaps
	their size (har, har)

1.1
	smarter argv[] analysis: the first argument which does neither look
	like an environment variable nor dash-prefixed options, is assumed
	to be a file path. If there are no signs of it being a full ARC
	path, OSLoadPartition is prepended to it.
	The old behaviour was to only accept filenames starting with "/", and
	thus always relative to OSLoadPartition.

1.2
	IP28 support. Also, no longer refuse to run on IP26 systems, they
	will hopefully run at some point in the future.

static const char version[] = "1.2";
