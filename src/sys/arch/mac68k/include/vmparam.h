/*
 * Machine dependent constants for mac68k -- mostly derived from hp300.

#include <m68k/vmparam.h>

/*
 * Constants which control the way the VM system deals with memory segments.
 * Most mac68k systems have only 1 physical memory segment, but some have 2.
 *
 * On the systems that have multiple segments, specifically the IIsi and   
 * IIci, the optimal configuration is to put the higher-density SIMMs in
 * bank B.  This is because the on-board video uses main memory in bank A
 * for the framebuffer, and a memory controller prevents access during   
 * video refresh cycles.  Even if both banks contain the same amount of
 * RAM, a minimum of ~320KB will be subtracted from the amount in bank A
 * for the framebuffer (if on-board video is in use).
