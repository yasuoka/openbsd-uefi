.Dt INSTALLBOOT 8 sparc64
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm installboot
.Nd install a bootstrap on an FFS filesystem partition
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm installboot
.Op Fl nv
.Ar bootblk
.Ar device
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm installboot
prepares a FFS filesystem partition for boot-strapping from the PROM.
The sparc bootblocks are split into two parts: a small first-stage program that
is written into the superblock area in a partition
.Po
and hence is limited in size to SBSIZE - DEV_BSIZE bytes
.Pc ,
and a second-stage program that resides in the filesystem proper.
The first-stage program is loaded into memory by the PROM. After it receiving
control, it loads the second stage program
.Ar ofwboot
from the filesystem.
The second-stage boot program uses the device driver interface to
the PROM and the stand-alone filesystem code in
.Dq libsa.a
to locate and load the kernel.
The second-stage boot program and the prototype code for the
first-stage bootprogram can be found in
.Pa /usr/mdec/ofwboot
and
.Pa /usr/mdec/bootblk
respectively. The second-stage program commonly resides in the root directory
as
.Pa /ofwboot .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Fl n
Do not actually write anything on the disk.
.It Fl v
Verbose mode.
.El
.Pp
The arguments are:
.Bl -tag -width ofwboot
.It Ar bootblk
the name of the prototype file for the first stage boot program.
.It Ar device
the name of the raw device in which the first-stage boot program
is to be installed.  This should correspond to the block device
on which the file system containing
.Ar ofwboot
is mounted.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following command will install the first-stage bootblocks in the
root filesystem
.Pq assumed to be mounted on Dq sd0a
using the file
.Pa /ofwboot
as the second-level boot program:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
installboot /usr/mdec/bootblk /dev/rsd0a
.Ed
.Sh BUGS
.Nm
requires simultaneous access to the mounted file system and
the raw device, but that is not allowed with the kernel
.Dv securelevel
variable set to a value greater than zero
.Pq the default ,
so
.Nm installboot
only works in single-user mode
.Pq or insecure mode - see Xr init 8 .
