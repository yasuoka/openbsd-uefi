NetBSD/mvme68k port

supported environment:

	Motorola makes a number of m68k VME cards.  This port
currently only works on the m68030 based VME147 card (diskless only
for now).

requirements:
	- VME147 card
	- a machine to connect the console to
	- network connection
	- NFS server (to serve root and swap)

future plans:
	- VME147 scsi disk support
	- hopefully, support for the VME162 card


how to boot:
	Booting NetBSD/mvme68k on a VME147 is somewhat painful because
the ROM doesn't know how to talk to the ethernet chip.   I have solved
this problem by downloading a bootstrap into RAM via the console line.

	First, you will need a m68k8k NFS mountable /usr and root
directory.  NetBSD/sun3 binaries will run fine on the mvme68k system
for the most part (the exception being kvm stuff).  These binaries can
be ftp'd from ftp.netbsd.org.  You will also need a NetBSD/mvme68k
kernel and related bootstraps.   For now these can be obtained from
dworkin.wustl.edu in /dist/netbsd/mvme68k_boot.tar.gz (once I get set
up I will put these plus a snapshot on ftp.netbsd.org).

	Put the mvme68k "netbsd" binary in NFS root directory.  Put
boot.vme147 in /tftpboot of your NFS server machine.  Make a symbolic
link from the hex encoding of your IP address to that file.  For
example:

lrwxrwxrwx  1 root     11 Apr 13 17:27 80FCA93F.147 -> boot.vme147


[80FCA93F is the IP address (128.252.169.63) of my vme147.]

Make sure you've got the right info in /etc/ethers and /etc/bootparams 
on your server.


Now, bring up your 147.  You should have the "bug" prompt:

COLD Start

Onboard  RAM start = $00000000,  stop = $007FFFFF

147-Bug>


Make sure the "stop" looks ok (if you've got 8MB you should have the
same value as I).  Also make sure the clock is ticking:

147-Bug>time
Sunday   5/30/27   16:25:14
147-Bug>time
Sunday   5/30/27   16:25:15
147-Bug>


Looks good.  you now need to download "sboot" into RAM.  you can
either do that through the console line or through a 2nd serial
connection.  I have my 147 connected to a sun4/110 and I access it via
"tip".  to load that way do this:

lo 0
~Ccat sboot
go 4000

which will look like this:
147-Bug>
147-Bug>lo 0
~CLocal command? cat sboot

away for 11 seconds 
!

147-Bug>g 4000
Effective address: 00004000 

sboot: serial line bootstrap program (&end = 5fd8)

>>> 


Now, if you want to do it through serial line 1, then connect serial
line one to a machine.  At the "147-Bug> " prompt do this "tm
1"... you should then login to what ever machine it is connected to.
Then hit "^A" to escape to Bug.  do "lo 1;x=cat sboot" ... then when
that is done you can reconnect "tm 1" and logout.  Then do "go 4000"
and you've got ">>> " prompt of sboot.


Once you've got the ">>> " prompt you can do commands such as:
"b"		- boot "netbsd" multiuser
"b gennetbsd"	- boot "gennetbsd" multiuser
"b -s"		- boot "netbsd" single user
"b gennetbsd -s"- boot "gennetbsd" single user

A typical boot looks like this:

>>> b
le0: ethernet address: 8:0:3e:20:cb:87
My ip address is: 128.252.169.63
Server ip address is: 128.252.169.2
