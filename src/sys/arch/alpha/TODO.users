The NetBSD/Alpha "User" To-Do List


The following are things that I'd like to see "users" of NetBSD/Alpha do.
It's unlikely that I'll get around to them in any reasonable time
frame, and I think they _should_ get done.

If you think of something that should be added to this list (and don't
want to do it yourself, right then 8-), send me mail and I'll add it.

If you're planning to work on something on this list, send me mail and
tell me about it, so that I can keep people from duplicating work.
Once you've done something on this list, send me context diffs.

Make GDB work.
	(1) function arguments and local variables don't seem to work.

Test programs; find and fix bugs.  In particular:
	(1) make sure accounting works
	(2) figure out why strip doesn't seem to work
	(3) last i checked, 'file' core dumped
	(4) /usr/games

Make TurboChannel option slots work reasonably.  This will require
    different sets of code to be written on the 3000/[4-9]00 and on the
    3000/300 families.  It shouldn't be too hard, but you will need some
    devices that live in option slots.

Once TC option slots work, somebody with a TC ethernet board should
    make it work, for completeness.

Get the GNU tools to generate a.out binaries for the alpha.  Once that
    is done:
	(1) make gprof work, then profile the kernel and tell me how
	    bad my assumptions lost.
	(2) make the rest of the NetBSD a.out-manipulation tools (e.g.
	    nm) work.

Make DDB work.  (For completeness, may require a.out kernel binaries
    and/or some ecoff symbol handling code to be written; the former
    is strongly preferred.)

Track down bugs caused by compiling the kernel with -O.  (At least
    some of these are likely to be code generation bugs.)
