NOT YET READY!!!

This port is heavily based on the NetBSD powerpc port by
Wolfgang Solfrank. All of the kernel code is derived from there.
Some modifications have been made, primarily to support ELF.

Until this README file states that the port is ready, it is unlikey
that the port will build correctly.

Currently, dont even try, go ahead and look at the code, but
nothing has been tried since It was checked in.

I hope to have this ready before Jan 1997
