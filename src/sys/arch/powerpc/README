This port is partly based on the NetBSD powerpc port by Wolfgang Solfrank.
The NetBSD code was imported by Dale Rahn who also added support for ELF.

A lot of code has been removed and a lot of new code has been added to
create a monolithic kernel that uses OpenFirmware or any other boot plattform
as little possible.

The current kernel supports PowerMac G4 and iMacs, additional machines
may be supported to varying degrees.


TODO:
	ptrace support finished (gdb can breakpoint, but not step)
