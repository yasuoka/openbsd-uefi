This port is partly based on the NetBSD powerpc port by Wolfgang Solfrank.
The NetBSD code was imported by Dale Rahn who also added support for ELF.

The current shape of the PowerPC port is a result of a work performed by
Per Fogelstrom, Opsycon AB. The work was sponsored by RTMX Inc, North
Carolina, USA.

A lot of code has been removed and a lot of new code has been added to
create a monolithic kernel that uses OpenFirmware or any other boot plattform
as little possible.

The current kernel supports MCG Powerstack family of machines DT-604, MT-604,
Series E, Powerstack Pro[234]000 and V.I Power.4e PowerPC 604 based VME board.
More will come in the future. Openfirmware is required for all systems.
Powerstack family machines with 603 processor will only work with certain
versions of openfirmware, not the latest versions however, older versions.

Support for Openfirmware drivers was reintroduced, in a manner which
is compatible with "real" drivers.
If done carefully OF drivers and hardware drivers can be mixed, if
however a hardware driver is configured, then OF tries to access the 
device, it can hang the system.

TODO:
	ptrace support finished (gdb can breakpoint, but not step)
	fp (setround, getround, getmask, setmask, setsticky, getsticky)
