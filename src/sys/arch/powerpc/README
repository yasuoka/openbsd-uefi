NOT YET READY!!!

This port is heavily based on the NetBSD powerpc port by
Wolfgang Solfrank. All of the kernel code is derived from there.
Some modifications have been made, primarily to support ELF.

Until this README file states that the port is ready, it is unlikey
that the port will build correctly.

Currently, dont even try, go ahead and look at the code, but
nothing has been tried since It was checked in.

I hope to have this ready before Jan 1997

Other notes:
	libexec/ftpd (ftpd.o) does not compile with optimization.
	`cc: Internal compiler error: program cc1 got fatal signal 11'
	Real cause unknown. will compile and work correctly
	if compiled without -O.

	a problem exists compiling the file:
	gnu/usr.bin/binutils/opcodes/ppc-opc.c
	with the normal data ulimit. it is necessary to raise
	the ulimit to compile this file in (pd)ksh use "ulimit -d 200000".

TODO:
	ptrace support
	fp (setround, getround, getmask, setmask, setsticky, getsticky)
