This port is heavily based on the NetBSD powerpc port by
Wolfgang Solfrank. All of the kernel code is derived from there.
Some modifications have been made, primarily to support ELF.


Other notes:
	libexec/ftpd (ftpd.o) does not compile with optimization.
	`cc: Internal compiler error: program cc1 got fatal signal 11'
	Real cause unknown. will compile and work correctly
	if compiled without -O.
	(worked around with a makefile change)

	a problem exists compiling the file:
	gnu/usr.bin/binutils/opcodes/ppc-opc.c
	with the normal data ulimit. it is necessary to raise
	the ulimit to compile this file in (pd)ksh use "ulimit -d 200000".
	(problem still exists)

	examine src/sys/arch/powerpc/patches, that file may contain
	changes necessary to the tree to rebuild the full system.

TODO:
	ptrace support (that works)
	fp (setround, getround, getmask, setmask, setsticky, getsticky)
