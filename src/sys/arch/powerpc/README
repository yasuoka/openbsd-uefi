This port is partly based on the NetBSD powerpc port by Wolfgang Solfrank.
The NetBSD code was imported by Dale Rahn who also added support for ELF.

The current shape of the PowerPC port is a result of a work performed by
Per Fogelstrom, Opsycon AB. The work was sponsored by RTMX Inc, North
Carolina, USA.

A lot of code has been removed and a lot of new code has been added to
create a monolithic kernel that uses OpenFirmware or any other boot plattform
as little possible.

The current kernel supports only V.I Power.4e PowerPC 604 based VME board.
More will come in the future.

Support for Openfirmware drivers was reintroduced, in a manner which
should be compatible with "real" drivers. It is yet to be seen if
a kernel can have both OF drivers and real drivers. But at least
both versions can be built.

Other notes:
	libexec/ftpd (ftpd.o) does not compile with optimization.
	`cc: Internal compiler error: program cc1 got fatal signal 11'
	Real cause unknown. will compile and work correctly
	if compiled without -O.
	(worked around with a makefile change)

	This probably has changed with the introduction of gcc 2.8.X.X
	but not completely verified (yet).

TODO:
	ptrace support (that works)
	fp (setround, getround, getmask, setmask, setsticky, getsticky)
