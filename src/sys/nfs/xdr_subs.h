/*
 * Macros used for conversion to/from xdr representation by nfs...
 * These use the MACHINE DEPENDENT routines ntohl, htonl
 * As defined by "XDR: External Data Representation Standard" RFC1014
 *
 * To simplify the implementation, we use ntohl/htonl even on big-endian
 * machines, and count on them being `#define'd away.  Some of these
 * might be slightly more efficient as quad_t copies on a big-endian,
 * but we cannot count on their alignment anyway.
