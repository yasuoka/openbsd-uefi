/*
 * Interface for handling time driven events in the kernel.
 *
 * The basic component of this API is the struct timeout. The user should not
 * touch the internals of this structure, but it's the users responsibility
 * to allocate and deallocate timeouts.
 *
 * Ther functions used to manipulate timeouts are:
 *  - timeout_set(timeout, function, argument)
 *      Initializes a timeout struct to call the function with the argument.
 *      A timeout only needs to be initialized once.
 *  - timeout_add(timeout, ticks)
 *      Schedule this timeout to run in "ticks" ticks (there are hz ticks in
 *      one second). You may not touch the timeout with timeout_set once the
 *      timeout is scheduled. A second call to timeout_add with an already
 *      scheduled timeout will cause the old timeout to be canceled and the
 *      new will be scheduled.
 *  - timeout_del(timeout)
 *      Remove the timeout from the timeout queue. It's legal to remove
 *      a timeout that has already happened.
 *
 * These functions may be called in interrupt context (anything below splhigh).
 *
 * XXX - the old timeout()/untimeout() API is kept for compatibility, you may
 *       not use the new API if there is a risk that the same function/argument
 *       pairs are mixed in the new and old API.
