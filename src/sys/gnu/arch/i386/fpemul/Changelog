$OpenBSD: Changelog,v 1.1 1996/08/27 10:32:38 downsj Exp $

This file contains the changes made to W. Metzenthem's 387 FPU
emulator to make it work under NetBSD.

a, Changes to make it compile:
	
	1 - Changed the #include's to get the appropriate .h files.
	2 - Renamed .S to .s, to satisfy the kernel Makefile.
	3 - Changed the C++ style // comments to /* */
	4 - Changed the FPU_ORIG_EIP macro. A letter from bde included
		in the package suggested using tf_isp for using instead
		of the linux __orig_eip. This later turned out to interfere
		with the user stack, so i created a separate variable, stored
		in the i387_union.
	5 - Changed the get_fs_.. put_fs_.. fns to fubyte,fuword,subyte,
		suword.
	6 - Removed the verify_area fns. I don't really know what they do,
		i suppose they verify access to memory. The sufu routines
		should do this.

b, Changes to make it work:
	
	1 - Made math_emulate() to return 0 when successful, so trap() won't
		try to generate a signal.
	2 - Changed the size of the save87 struct in /sys/arch/i387/include/
		npx.h to accomodate the i387_union.
	
d, Other changes:

	1 - Removed obsolate and/or linux specific stuff.
	2 - Changed the RE_ENTRANT_CHECK_[ON|OFF] macro to
		REENTRANT_CHECK([ON|OFF]) so indent can grok it.
	3 - Re-indented to Berkeley style.
	4 - Limited max no of lookaheads. LOOKAHEAD_LIMIT in fpu_entry.c
