The file `README.ext2fs' is from the Lites; `COPYRIGHT.INFO' is from
FreeBSD.

OpenBSD's version of the ext2fs is based on Lites and FreeBSD, but doesn't
preserve support for those operating systems; doing so would've imposed
far too much of an #ifdef farm upon the code.

Right now, I wouldn't try using this.  It's still being worked on, and
several things are potentially very broken.
