.Sh NAME
.Nm aic7xxx_asm
.Nd Assembler for the Adaptec aic7xxx family of asics
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm aic7xxx_asm
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl D Ar variable=value
.Op Fl v
.Op Fl o Ar file
.Ar source-file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The Adaptec aic7xxx family of asics are single chip SCSI controllers with a 
RISC like command processor.  This assembler parses the language outlined
in the Adaptec technical document
.%T "AIC-7770 (EISA/ISA Bus Master Single-Chip SCSI Host Adaptor) Data Book"
and produces ascii output intended for a C byte array.
.Pp
The aic7xxx assembler is required to compile kernels with aic7xxx SCSI
adaptor support (AHA-274x, AHA-284x, AHA-294x controllers) and is compiled,
installed, and used automatically in the kernel compile directory when 
necessary.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl D Ar variable=value
Define 
.Ar variable
to be 
.Ar value
in the global context
.It Fl d 
Turn on debugging
.It Fl v 
Print version information
.It Fl o Ar file 
Redirect assembler output to
.Ar file
