/*
 * ISA interrupt handler manipulation.
 * 
 * To establish an ISA interrupt handler, a driver calls isa_intr_establish()
 * with the interrupt number, type, level, function, and function argument of
 * the interrupt it wants to handle.  Isa_intr_establish() returns an opaque
 * handle to an event descriptor if it succeeds, and invokes panic() if it
 * fails.  (XXX It should return NULL, then drivers should handle that, but
 * what should they do?)  Interrupt handlers should return 0 for "interrupt
 * not for me", 1  for "I took care of it", or -1 for "I guess it was mine,
 * but I wasn't expecting it."
 *
 * To remove an interrupt handler, the driver calls isa_intr_disestablish() 
 * with the handle returned by isa_intr_establish() for that handler.
