# Config.new file and device description for machine-independent PCMCIA code.
# Included by ports that need it.

# ports should define their own "device pcmcia" line (like the one below,
# but with the correct bus attachment).

#define  pcmciabus {[port = -1], [size = 0],  
#                [iomem = -1], [iosiz = 0],
#                [irq = -1], [drq = -1]}
