/*
 * This is a PCI shim for the Wavelan wireless network driver.
 * It works with PCI adaptors based on the PLX 9050 and PLX 9052
 * PCI to "dumb bus" bridge chip.  It has been tested with the
 * Global Sun Technology GL24110P02 (aka Linksys WDT11) and is
 * expected to work with the Global Sun GL24110P and Eumitcom WL11000P.
 *
 * All we do here is handle the PCI match and attach, set up an
 * interrupt handler entry point, and setup the PLX chip for level
 * interrupts and config index 1.
 *
 * The PLX 9052 provides us with multiple PCI address space mappings.
 * The primary mappings at PCI registers 0x10 (mem) and 0x14 (I/O) are for
 * the PLX chip itself, *NOT* the pcmcia card.
 * The PLX 9052 provides 4 local address space registers: 0x18, 0x1C,
 * 0x20, and 0x24.  The mem and I/O spaces for the PCMCIA card are
 * mapped to 0x18 and 0x1C respectively.
 *
 * The datasheet may be downloaded from PLX (though you do have to register)
 * http://www.plxtech.com/products/toolbox/9050.htm
