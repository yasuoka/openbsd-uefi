TODO :
------

- Move all mbuf code to if_fw.c. Make if_fw use the generic read/write/inreg
  and then it can translate the packets into the appropriate mbuf's.

- Need a tlabel alloc routine within fwohci and a way to use 64 tlabel's per
  node (rather than a global set of 64 as it's used now).

- Flesh out the documentation of the high level API in fwohci.c (fwlynx will
  need to implement the same thing so this should be more than just comments
  in fwohci.c).

- Track down issues where multiple hosts plugged into a firewire hub don't
  init/see all devices on resets sometimes.

- Should do topology maps, speed maps, the various bus managers, etc.

- Implement a real fwscsi scsibus, with each attached device as a new
  target/lun. Not a new scsibus per device.

- Implement proper handlers with either 1 main thread, or timeouts and
  callbacks.

- Move all the SBP2 data manipulation routines to SBP2 codebase.

==============================================================================

DONE :
------

- Move SBP2 routines into their own file.

- Rewrite ROM parsing/validation. Unroll all recursion, add ref counting, path
  elimination, etc.

- Move rom routines into their own files to allow easier cross usage.

- Write sub match setup for fwnode/fwscsi so matching devices listed in the
  ROM can be done via autoconf.

- Remove all of the devcap stuff.

- SBP2 needs a complete API written up: logins, ORB management/allocation, etc. 
  (basic routines have been implemented).

- Add locator detection/usage into fwohci code.

- Change all FW_DEBUG wrapped printf's to DPRINTF macro's.

- Ack errors from a TX complete should get passed up to any registered
  callbacks.

- Make fwohci detach correctly (for cardbus/etc type interfaces).

- Use handler_set (with NULL cb) to create a higher level <bus>_unreg.

- Rewrite handler_set to allow sub regions, minimums, etc without having to
  register 100 callbacks for 100 quad reads.
