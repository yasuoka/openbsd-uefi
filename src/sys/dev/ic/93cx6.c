 *
 *   The 93C46 has a four wire interface: clock, chip select, data in, and
 *   data out.  In order to perform one of the above functions, you need
 *   to enable the chip select for a clock period (typically a minimum of
 *   1 usec, with the clock high and low a minimum of 750 and 250 nsec
 *   respectively.  While the chip select remains high, you can clock in
 *   the instructions (above) starting with the start bit, followed by the
 *   OP code, Address, and Data (if needed).  For the READ instruction, the
 *   requested 16-bit register contents is read from the data out line but
 *   is preceded by an initial zero (leading 0, followed by 16-bits, MSB
 *   first).  The clock cycling from low to high initiates the next data
 *   bit to be sent from the chip.
