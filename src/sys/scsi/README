--------------making devices------------
see st(1) and st(4) for info on tape devices.

---------ioctl definitions-------------
User accessable structures (e.g. ioctl definitions) have been
placed in sys/cdio, sys/sgio and sys/chio (based after sys/mtio for
the ioctls for mag tapes (including st).
General scsi ioctls are found in sys/scsiio.h.

-----------cd-rom-----------------
Cdrom audio is only suported at all for cdroms that use SCSI2 audio
definitions.

-------------media changer---------------
Once again courtesy of grefen@convex.com (in germany)
I have not tested this but he assures me it's ready for testing.
If anyone has an exabyte tape changer or similar, 
contact the author for information regarding the control interface
and program.

WARNING: This has not been tested for a LONG TIME!
